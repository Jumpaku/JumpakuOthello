### Getting a move from AI

|  | URI Path | Method | Request body type | Response body type |
|-------------------------|------------------------|--------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|

### Example of Getting a move from AI

Request

Response

```json
{
  "move": 18
}

If there is no position to place disc, you recieve `{ "move": -1 }`.

### Definition of Types

```ts
type Disc = "Dark" | "Light";
```

```ts
type Board = {
    darkDiscs: number[],
    lightDiscs: number[],
};
```

* `darkDiscs` in `Board` represents a list of position indices where dark disc is placed. Each position index `n` in `darkDiscs` represents a position (`Math.floor(n/8)`, `n%8`) on the board.
* `lightDiscs` in `Board` represents a list of position indices where dark disc is placed. Each position index `n` in `lightDiscs` represents a position (`Math.floor(n/8)`, `n%8`) on the board.

```ts
type Completed = {
    state: "Completed",
    darkCount: number,
    lightCount: number
};
```

* `state: "Completed"` in `Completed` represents that the game has been completed.
* `darkCount` in `Completed` represents the number of dark discs on the board.
* `lightCount` in `Completed` represents the number of light discs on the board.

```ts
type InProgress = {
    state: "InProgress",
    selectPlayer: Disc,
    availableMoves: number[]
};
```

* `state: "InProgress"` in `InProgress` represents that the game is in progress.
* `selectPlayer` in `InProgress` represents a color of the disc of player who is making a move.
* `availableMoves` in `InProgress` represents a list of position indices where the current player can select. If there is no position to place a disc, `availableMoves` is `[-1]`.

```ts
type GameStateBase = {
    board: Board,
    history: number[],
};
```

* `board` in `GameStateBase` represents current board of the game.
* `history` in `GameStateBase` represents a list of position indices where the players has been placed.

```ts
type GameState = GameStateBase & (Completed | InProgress);
```

```ts
type Error = {
    message: string
};
```

* `message` in `Error` represents error message from the API server.

```ts
type GameStateResult = GameState | Error;
```

```ts
type MoveResult = { move: number } | Error;
```
